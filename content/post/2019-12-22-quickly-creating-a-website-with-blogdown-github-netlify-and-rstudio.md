## The Challenge: Build a fully fledged website within one week

As I sit here a couple of days before Christmas I have set myself a goal of publishing a fully functioning website using Yihue's wonderful R package blogdown.

Why I am doing this:
- Writing and publishing information is a wonderful way to collect my thoughts

## The Stack

## Getting Started MVP

Ok, so first I want to create a minimum viable site. 
- I have R, RStudio and Git installed on my laptop
- blogdown and all its dependencies are installed
- I have signed up to Github and Netlify
- Create my Github repository
- Start a blogdown project
- Configure the blogdown site and edit the About page
- Write a couple of posts
- Push to Github and publish
- Google analytics and Disqus
- Done

Because this is an MVP I am skipping a few steps such as playing with themes. I have found in the past that this is a rabbit hole that I can waste so much time. The website is designed to publish my writing and code. The base theme used in blogdown is perfectly serviceable for this. Future iterations of the website may use the Academic theme which produces very clean and extensible websites
